# Neighborhood Map

A project where you develop a single-page appilcation **(SPA)** that features a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. To get started, you will have to explore and learn about frameworks, libraries, APIs availaible for this project.



You will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.
